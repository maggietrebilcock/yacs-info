Minimum Viable Products:

*a student's major, minor, and COHORT should be saved in their account, and autopopulate, but they should be
able to change these to see what it would be like to change their majors. It should also be functional if
you are not logged in, so prospective students, parents, etc can use it.

1) Set up with basic eight semesters, including an option to choose which semester in junior/senior year
you plan on doing Arch away. There is an option in the corner to add major, minor, pathway, etc, and then
all your requirements show up underneath.

2) Credit bar/tracking: essentially a bar that is more filled up with how many credits you currently have on your page.

3) Suggested semesters: When you add a major, it will autopopulate with what semester the catalog suggests you take them. 
This will require going back into the JSON to add that information.

4) Prerequisites: When you add a class to your semester plan before its prereq, it will have a red dot 
or something next to it letting you know. It should also allow you to click on the dot and select 'Transfer
credits' or 'override' so people can manually get rid of the red dot.

5) Integrates what quatalog does: based on previous years, you can only move a class into spring, fall, or summer 
based on whether that class is normally offered there.

6) Allows for students to save a worksheet in their account, and make an entirely new one for funsies.
