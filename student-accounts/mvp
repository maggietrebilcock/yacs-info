Minimum viable product for the accounts students are able to make. Currently, students can make an account but they
can't do anything with it. Hopefully, we will eventually be able to make the site accessible when you are not on RPI wifi. 
In that scenario, we should make it that you need an RPI email to make an account.

1) Profile page where students can see and change their basic information: name, cohort, major and such, etc. 

2) Students should be able to save planned courses for a semester or their saved four-year plans.

3) Students can enter the classes they have already taken and their transfer credits so that when making a four year plan, 
it will solidify in there and can't be changed.

4) Perhaps eventually: students can add friends within their profile. They can then view other student's profiles and see a 
semester schedule that that student has posted. Students can choose whether or not to post a schedule for an upcoming
semester. If a friend has posted their schedule, maybe when I am planning my schedule for the upcoming semester, there can be
a little note next to a class I added that notifies me my friend plans on taking it. This is truly last priority, but I
would love to see the following features:
  - ability to plan study groups and the like based on students taking mutual classes
  - the ability for professors to write notes about their classes
  - this could lead to a new page: a feed, which you could scroll through and see requests for study groups, posts by
  professors advocating for students to take specific classes
